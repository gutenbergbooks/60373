  <h2 class='c005'>Introduction.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The narrative of the Patient Griselda is one of the most
wide-spread of the stories which have come down to us from
the Middle Ages. It has been annexed to the highest literature
by such poets as Boccaccio, Petrarch and Chaucer, and has been
brought within reach of the meanest capacities by the ballad-mongers
and the writers of penny histories.</p>

<p class='c007'>We cannot trace the story back farther than the middle of
the fourteenth century, when Boccaccio incorporated it into his
<cite>Decameron</cite> (day 10, novel 10); but it must have had a previous
existence in Italy, for Petrarch says in his letter to Boccaccio
that when he read it in the <cite>Decameron</cite> he remembered how
pleased he had been with it when he heard it many years
before. When his memory was thus revived in the story that
charmed him so much he set to work to learn it by heart, so
that he might repeat it to his friends. He then translated it
into Latin for the benefit of those who did not know Italian.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>That he did repeat the story to his friend we learn from the
Clerk of Oxenford’s Prologue to his tale in the <cite>Canterbury
Tales</cite>, where he says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I wil yow telle a tale, which that I</div>
      <div class='line'>Lerned at Padowe of a worthy clerk,</div>
      <div class='line'>As provyd by his wordes and his werk.</div>
      <div class='line'>He is now deed, and nayled in his chest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now God yive his soule wel good rest!</div>
      <div class='line'>Fraunces Petrark, the laureat poete,</div>
      <div class='line'>Highte this clerk, whos rethorique swete</div>
      <div class='line'>Enlumynd al Ytail of poetrie.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. See <cite>Originals and Analogues of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales</cite>, part ii. pp. 150–176
(Chaucer Society).</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There has been much controversy over these words. We
must all wish to believe that Chaucer met Petrarch at Padua
and was friendly with him; but although it is highly probable
that he did so we have no actual evidence other than this
passage. Some say that Chaucer is not speaking here in his
own name but in that of a fictitious character, and therefore
the statement goes for nothing. Another objection is that here
Chaucer’s indebtedness to Boccaccio is overlooked and all the
credit is given to Petrarch. It is highly probable however that
Chaucer was interested in the story from Petrarch’s talk, and
that when he decided to make it one of his Canterbury Tales
he adapted it from Petrarch’s translation of Boccaccio, which is
referred to farther on in the Prologue:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I say that he first with heigh stole enditeth</div>
      <div class='line'>(Er he the body of his tale writith)</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span>A proheme, in the which descrivith he</div>
      <div class='line'>Piemounde, and of Saluces the contre,</div>
      <div class='line'>And spekith of Appenyne the hulles hye,</div>
      <div class='line'>That ben the boundes of al west Lombardye.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That this is the true origin of the Clerk’s tale is confirmed
by the fact that Petrarch varied somewhat from Boccaccio’s
original, and in these variations Chaucer follows Petrarch. An
impossible tale such as this requires all the art of the true poet
to make it delightful to us, and this of course we have in
Chaucer. It is far different when we come to read the
common-place prose of the chap-book or the equally common-place
verse of the ballad-monger.</p>

<p class='c007'>The picture of patience carried to the extreme in the wife
and of brutal violence in the husband is so out of harmony with
our present views that it is somewhat difficult to read the story
with patience. We are wrong, however, in taking it in this
spirit, and Professor Hales has so beautifully expressed the true
motive of this mediæval picture that I feel I cannot do better
than transfer to these pages his remarks in the publication of
the Chaucer Society containing <cite>Originals and Analogues of some
of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales</cite>:<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a>—“Now, it is the characteristic
of the unsophisticated mediæval litterateur that he deals with
one idea at a time. It would often lead to a highly injurious
conclusion to attach at all equal a moral importance or rather
any moral importance to the subordinate parts of what he sets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>forth. The central lesson is kept well in view; the others
must look to themselves. The principal figure is brought into
relief with enthusiasm;  on the mere surroundings and background
little or no care is spent.... And so in the story
of Griselda: if we would read it in the spirit of the day when
it became current we should not vex ourselves into any
righteous indignation against the immediate author of her most
touching distresses. The old story does not make the marquis a
monster in human shape; indeed, it represents him as a man of
a noble and lovable nature; if he is not so, then even in the
end Griselda reaps no earthly reward in permanently securing
his admiration and love. And yet this marquis perpetrates
inexpressible cruelties; he is a very wolf, ruthlessly teasing and
tearing the gentlest of lambs. The explanation is in accordance
with what has just been said: the patience of Griselda is the
one theme of the tale, and nothing else is to be regarded. In
relation to her the marquis has no moral being; he is a mere
means of showing forth her supreme excellence; a mere
mechanical expedient. He is no more morally than a thorn in
the saint’s footpath, or a wheel, or a cross. Surely it is vain to be
wroth with him. Who rages against the mere fire that enfolds
the martyr, or the nails that pierce the hands of a crucified
Believer? Indeed, nothing in the tale is of any ethical moment
but the carriage of the heroine herself. The eyes and the
heart of the old century when she first appeared were fastened
devoutly on that single form, and let all else go by. She is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>wifely obedience itself, nothing else. Before that virtue all
other virtues bow. It enjoys a complete monopoly, an absolute
sway. Other moral life is suspended in this representation of
it. She has but one function; for her there is but one sin
possible, and that is to murmur. She is all meekness, all
yielding, all resignation.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Part ii. 1875, p. 174.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Such a figure has comparatively few charms for us of these
latter days. But it pleased the world once—even down to
Shakespeare’s time, who himself portrayed it in one of his
earliest plays: Catherine in the <cite>Taming of the Shrew</cite> is a phase
of Griselda. Perhaps in ages when much most ignorant abuse
of women prevailed in literature—abuse springing mainly out of
the vile prejudices and superstitions of the mediæval Church—some
such figure might have been expected to arise. It is the
figure of a reaction. The hearts of men refused to accept the
dishonouring pictures so often drawn of their fellow mortals.
They rose in a loyal insurrection against lying fables of essential
wantonness and of shameful obstinacy. To such chivalrous
rebels the pale, sad, constant face of Griselda showed itself as
the image of far other experiences and histories; and they gazed
on it as on the face of their saint. With an infinite reverence
they saw her still calm and quiet in the midst of anguishes,
with heart breaking but lips uttering no ill word, with eyes
that through the tears with which kindly nature of herself
would relieve the terrible drought of sorrow still looked nothing
but inalienable tenderness and love.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>The French have claimed for their country the origination
of the story of Griselda; but their claim cannot be allowed.
The Abbé de Sade in his <cite>Life of Petrarch</cite> asserts that the story
is to be found in a manuscript called <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Parement des Dames</span></cite>;
but it appears that this manuscript was the work of Olivier de
la Marche, who was not born until long after the death of
Boccaccio. Boccaccio’s novel was translated into French and
published at Paris about the year 1510 as <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Patience de
Grisilidis</span></cite>; it was published also at Troyes about 1562. Apparently,
however, the French were the first to bring Griselda
upon the stage; for, according to Warton, the Comedians of
Paris represented a mystery in French verse entitled <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Mystere
de Griseildis, Marquis de Saluces, mis en rime françoise et par
personnaiges</span></cite> in 1393. This was not printed until about 1550,
when Jehan Bonfons published it at Paris. His edition was
reprinted in 1832.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ralph Radcliffe, a somewhat voluminous play-writer, who
flourished towards the close of the reign of Henry VIII., is
said by John Bale to have written an English comedy entitled
“Patient Griselde,” and Hans Sachs in Germany converted
the story into a drama as early as 1550; but in Italy, the land
of its birth, it was not dramatised until 1620.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not possible for a story which had early taken such a
strong hold upon the popular imagination to remain long
without becoming the property of the ballad-writer, but we
cannot tell if he forestalled the writer of popular histories.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>In the Stationers’ Registers we find three entries of Griselda
as early as the year 1565–6; the following two relate to the
ballad:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c007'>Rd. of Owyn Rogers, for his lycense for pryntinge of a
ballett intituled the sounge of pacyente Gressell unto hyr
make [mate]</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>iiij d.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Rd. of Wylliam greffeth, for his lycense for pryntinge of
ij ballettes to the tune of pacyente gressell</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>iiij d.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</blockquote>

<p class='c007'>Now the second of these entries seems to point to an earlier
ballad, as it must have taken some time for the tune of Patient
Grissell to become so popular; and therefore there is great
probability in Mr. Chappell’s conjecture that the original ballad
was published before 1557, in which year the Registers commence.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the ballads of Griselda now in existence are essentially
the same as that printed in <cite>The Garland of Goodwill</cite> by Thomas
Deloney; and, as the same ballad, divided into chapters with
prose chapters at the beginning and end, is printed in <cite>The
Pleasant and Sweet History of Patient Grissell</cite> (reprinted by
Mr. Collier for the Percy Society), it has been suggested that
this tract was also written by Deloney. This famous ballad-monger
is supposed to have commenced writing about the
year 1586, so that it is probable that the ballad of 1565–6, and
the even earlier one suggested above, have ceased to exist. The
following is a list of the different titles of Deloney’s ballad:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>A most pleasant Ballad of patient Grissell, to the tune of

<p class='c007'>When Mr. J. Payne Collier edited for the Percy Society
“The History of Patient Grisel, two early Tracts in Black-Letter,
with an Introduction and Notes,” 1842, he printed
after the <cite>Ancient, True, and Admirable History</cite> “The Pleasant
and Sweet History of Patient Grissell, shewing how she from
a poore man’s daughter came to be a great lady of France,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>being a Patterne to all vertuous women. Translated out of
Italian. London. Printed by E. P. for John Wright, dwelling
in Giltspur Street at the Signe of the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is divided into eleven chapters, of which 1, 2, 10, and
11, are in prose; chapters 3 to 9 contain the ballad referred to
previously, and it is most probable that the whole tract was the
production of Deloney. The date is cut off, but the pamphlet
was probably printed about 1630, and it is doubtless a late
edition of a popular chap-book. The copy in the British
Museum is apparently the same as that used by Mr. Collier.
It is handsomely bound in morocco, and in the inside is written
in pencil, “Cost me eight pounds unbound.” There are two
titles: the first is “The History of the Noble Marques,” with
a woodcut of Griselda at the spinning-wheel. On the back of
this is the woodcut of Elizabeth, reproduced on the title of the
Percy Society reprint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The play of Ralph Radcliffe is now lost, so that the comedy
published in 1603 and reprinted in 1841 is the only one known
to exist. We have here a curious instance of the danger of
asserting of any particular book that it is unique. When
Mr. Collier reprinted the play for the Shakespeare Society
he said that there was no copy in the British Museum, and
that the only copies he knew of were one in the Bodleian
and another in the possession of the Duke of Devonshire,
who also had an imperfect copy which he presented to Collier.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>There is now a copy in the British Museum, and in it is this
note in ink: “The only copy extant.—J. B. 1788.” Under
this is a pencil note: “I have seen another copy, but it was
imperfect—G. N.” On the title-page is written “William
Shakespeare,” apparently one of the Ireland forgeries.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following entry occurs in Henslowe’s Diary:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p class='c007'>“Received in earnest of Patient Grissell by us Tho. Dekker,

<p class='c007'>The Robert Shaa or Shaw here mentioned was, Mr. Collier
tells us, one of the temporary managers of the company of
the Earl of Nottingham’s players. The comedy was entered
at Stationers’ Hall for publication on the 28th March, 1600,
as “the Plaie of Patient Grissell,” but it did not appear until
three years afterwards.</p>

<p class='c007'>On August 30th, 1667, Pepys saw at Bartholomew Fair the
puppet play of “Patient Grizill,” and Warton in a note to
his <cite>History of English Poetry</cite> writes: “I need not mention that
it is to this day represented in England on a stage of the lowest
species and of the highest antiquity: I mean a puppet show.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Patient Countess,” in Percy’s <cite>Reliques</cite> from Warner’s
<cite>Albions England</cite>, is a totally different story from that of the
patient wife of the Marquis Walter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Warton mentions a MS. poem by William Forrest, and, as
it has lately been printed, I give the title here, although it
contains no notice of the original Grisild.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>The Griselda literature is a tolerably large one, and it is
therefore scarcely necessary in this place to give more than the
above general indication of an interesting subject. It may be
noted that the titles of the works on the subject in the library
of the British Museum occupy nine pages of the manuscript
catalogue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The patience of Griselda is almost as much a common-place
of literature as that of Job, and writers are full of references to
her cruel fate. In a <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Balade</span></cite> translated by Lydgate from the
Latin “Grisilde’s humble patience” is recorded.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Thomas Feylde’s “Contraversye bytwene a Lover and
a Jaye,” printed without date by Wynkyn de Worde, we
read:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c009'>

<p class='c007'>We are told in <cite>Harry White his Humour</cite>, printed in 1660,
that, “having lately read the rare history of Patient Grizell,
out of it he hath drawne this phylosophicall position, that if
all women were of that woman’s condition we should have
no imployment for cuckin-stooles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The editor of the <cite>Collection of Old Ballads</cite>, 1723, slily
remarks:—“It may naturally be supposed that he [the poet]
had unfortunately married a shrew, and was willing to preach
up the doctrine of patience to wives, by shewing them the
blessings that attend this great uncommon virtue; and I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>inserted it, thinking that amongst my readers I might have
some husbands who would be glad of carrying such an
excellent song to their wives” (vol. i. p. 252).</p>

<p class='c007'>Much of the popularity of the story must be due to Chaucer,
who first introduced it to English readers and endued it with
so much poetic beauty and grace.</p>

Saluss, in which is Exemplified the true Obedience
and Noble Behaviour of Vertuous Women towards
their Husbands.</em></span></p>

<h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chap. I.</span><br /> <span class='c010'>How the Marquesse of Saluss passed the time of his youth without any desire of mariage, till he was requested by the faire entreatie of a favorite, and other gentlemen, to affect a wife, both for the good of the country and the honour of himselfe; with his answer to the same.</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>Betweene the mountaines of Italy and France, towards the
south, lyes the territory of Salus, a country flourishing with
excellent townes and castles, and peopled with the best sort of
gentles and peasants: amongst whom there lived not long
since a nobleman of great hope and expectation, lord of the
country, by name Gualter, Marquesse of Saluss; to whom, as
the government appertained by right of inheritance, so their
obedience attended by desert of his worthinesse.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was young in yeeres, noble of lineage, and such attractive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>demeanour, that the best thought it a pleasure to bee commanded
by him, and the worst grew more tractable by his
good example: his delight was in hunting and hawking, and
the pleasure of the time present extinguished the care of the
time to come; for he thought not of mariage, nor to entangle
himselfe with the inconveniences of a wife; till at last the
people and noblemen of his country projected the contrary, as
discontented to see him indisposed that way, and presaging a
kind of prosperity to themselves, if by his mariage posteritie
might arise to assure them the better how they might bestow
their obedience hereafter. Whereupon they assembled together,
and made one day amongst the rest a determiner of their resolutions,
choosing out for their speaker a noble knight of great
authority, faire demeanor, eloquent speech, and more inward
with the Marquesse then any of the rest; who, thus acquainted
with all their mindes, and prepared to utter his owne minde,
took an opportunity to acquaint the renowned Marquesse with
the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most honourable Sir, the great humanity extended towards
us, of which I most especially have participated, hath thus
emboldened me above others, to make a further triall of your
patience, and forbearing my rudeness: not that there is any
sufficiency or singularity in me above others, but in that heretofore
I have found you so generous toward all, I make no
question to finde you as gratious toward my selfe; and in that
it hath pleased you to accept of our love, wee are proud againe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>to be under your obedience; wherein we shall rejoice the more,
if you now accord to our request the sooner, which is, to marry
without delay. The time passeth, and will not be recalled,
your youth intreats it, and must not be denied; your country
importunes it, and would not bee opposed; your neighbours
desire it, and hope to bee satisfied; and all sorts request it, and
wish it for your honour; for when age approacheth, death
attends it at the heeles, and no man can tell when, or how it
will fall upon him. Therefore wee humbly request you to
accept our supplications, and accord to this importunity, that
we may provide by your appointment a lady worthy of your
honour and our subjection. In this wee are the more suppliant,
because it will rebound so much to the good of your
countrey, and the enlarging your renowne; for if it should so
fall out (which God forbid) that you die without issue, we may
lament the losse of our lord, but not redresse the complaints of
the people: we shall want you that was al our comfort, but
are sure of distresse to our everlasting trouble. If then you
either love your selfe, or pity us, frame a heart to this impression,
and leave not us to further feare and disquiet.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the noble lord had thus apprehended the petition of
his loving subjects, he resolved to answer them as gratiously as
they had propounded the businesse with regard of duty, and
so replied: My dearest friends, you have urged mee to a
matter, in which as yet I have beene a mere stranger; for
by nature I delight in liberty, and by custome continued my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>pleasures, both which must needs bee curbed by mariage, and
restrained by taking a wife: notwithstanding, I cast awaie all
doubts to pleasure you, and will thinke of no incombrances so
you be satisfied. For though mariage hath many difficulties
attending; especially, the feare of legitimation in our children,
and suspicion of that honour which lies on our wives honesty,
yet all shall be overcome with this resolution, that I shall please
you in the same; for I am resolved, if anie good come for
man’s contentment by mariage, it is from God, to whom I
submit this cause, and pray for the good successe of your wishes,
that I may live to maintaine your peace, as well as my owne
pleasure: and look, wherein my contentment shall enlarge mine
honour, your welfare shall be respected above my life; so that
(beleeve it) I will satisfie your demands, and apply my selfe to
the purpose. Only one thing I request at your hands; to
take in worth my choice, and neither insult if she be a princesse
of greatnes, nor repine if she be of meane estate; but love her
because I have loved you, and regard her howsoever in that she
is my wife; neither being curious nor inquisitive whom I will
chuse, nor disaffected when it is past remedy.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the company heard him out, and found him so willing
to their satisfaction, they gave him thankes with one heart for
his kinde admission, and answered with one tongue, he should
not find them repugnant; but they would honor his wife as the
princesse of the world, and be morigerous to him as the commander
of their soules. Thus did this new report (like a messenger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of glad tidings) fill all the marquisate with joy, and the
palace with delight, when they understood their lord would
marry, and in a manner heard the time appointed; for presently
it was proclaimed through the countrey, and a day
assigned for all commers to come to the court. The nobles
prepared themselves in the best manner: the ladies spared no
cost, either for ornaments of their bodies, or setting out their
beauties; the gentles flocked to please their lord, and were brave
to set out their owne greatnes: the citisens were rich in their
neatnes, and handsome in their attire: the officers were formall
in their showes, and sumptuous in their attendants; the countryman
had his variety, and the verie peasant his bravery; in a
word, al sorts gloried in the hope of that festivall, and every
man’s expectation attended the day of triumph. For never was
such a preparation in Saluss before, nor such a confluence of
people seene in that countrey; for besides the novelty, many
forraine princes came to celebrate this mariage, and to shew
their owne greatnes. Savoy was neare, and sent some from her
snowie hills: France as neare, and sent others from her fruitful
vines: Italy not far off, and sent many from her pleasant fields;
and the ilands round about kept none at home that would come.
Thus were his kinred invited, strangers admitted, his owne
people entertained, and all sorts welcommed; but as yet no
bride was seene, no woman named, no lady designed, no maid
published, no wife knowne: onely the preparation was much,
and the expectation greater.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>All this while the Marquesse continued his hunting, and as
he had accustomed, resorted much to a poore country village
not farre from Salusse, where there dwelt as poore a countriman,
named Janicole, overworne in yeares, and overcomne with distresse.
But as it happens many times that inward graces doe
moderate outward discommodities, and that God seasoneth
poverty with contentment and their sufficient supportation, so
had this poore man all his defects supplied in the admirable comfort
of one onely daughter, so composed, as if nature determined
a worke of ostentation. For such was her beauty in appearance,
and vertue in operation, that it put judicious men to an extasie
in the choice by comparison; but both united did heere grace
each other, and when they pretended an action, it was all to go
forward to perfection. And whereas in others this temporary
blessing gave wings to desire to bee seene and knowne abroad,
in her those innated vertues allaied the heat of all manner of
passion, and breakings out of frailty. The viands they had were
but meane, and the diet they kept was to satisfie nature: the
time was over-ruled by their stomachs, and the ceremonies they
used were thanks to God, and moderation in their repasts. The
utensiles of the house were homely, yet handsome in regard of
their cleanlinesse: that bed which they had the ould man lay
in, and the sweet daughter made shift with the ground. No
day passed without prayers and praises to God (for was it not
praiseworthy to have such grace in this disgrace), nor any night
without taking account of the day passed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Her exercise was to helpe her father in the morning, and
drive forth her sheep in the day time: hee was at home making
of nets, and shee abroad looking to her lambs: she was never
heard to wish for any better, but to thank God it was no worse.
No word of repining ever came from her mouth, or the least
grudge from her heart: at night she folded her sheep and
dressed her father’s supper, then lay they downe to rest, and
rested as well as in a bed of downe indeed. This was the glory
of their poverty, and memory of their contentment.</p>

<p class='c007'>But as fire will not be hid where there is matter combustible,
so vertue will not be obscured where there be tongues and
eares: nor could the Marquesse so hallow after his hawks and
hounds, but report hallowed in his eare as fast this wonderment;
insomuch that when it was confirmed by judicious
relation he made it not dainty to be behoulding to his owne
experience: which when he saw concurring with fame, the
miracle brought a kinde of astonishment; which continuing, the
properties of such novelties, increased to meditation: and so
comparing the rest with this rarity, he thought her a fit woman
to make his wife, supposing that if she were vertuous by nature,
she would not prove vicious by education; but rather as a
diamond is a stone of the same value whether set in lead or
horne, it must needs be of more excellency embellished with
gold and enamell. In which resolution hee prepared his heart,
and went forward with his businesse.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meane time the Court was daintily furnished, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>plate prepared, the apparell magnificent, the coronet rich, the
jewels precious, the ornaments exceeding, and all things befitting
the magnificence of a prince and the dignities of a
queen: only the nobles wondred, the ladies were amazed, the
damsells marvelled, the gentles disputed, the people flocked, and
all sorts attended to see who should possesse this wealth and bee
adorned with these robes. Till at last the nuptial day came
indeed: honour prepared the sumptuousness; fame divulged
the glory; hymen invited the guests; magnificence adorned
the roomes; the officers marshald the state, and all looked for a
bride; but who she was the next chapter must discover.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chap. II.</span><br /> <span class='c010'>How, after all this great preparation, the Marquesse of Saluss demanded Grisell of her poore father Janicola; and, espousing her, made her Marchionesse of Saluss.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When all things were extended to this glorious shew, the
Marquesse (as if he went to fetch his wife indeed) tooke with
him a great company of earls, lords, knights, squires, and gentlemen,
ladies, and attendants, and went from the palace into the
countrey toward Janicolas house; where the faire mayd Grisel,
knowing nothing of that which hapned, nor once dreaming of
that which was to come, had made her house and selfe somewhat
handsome, determining (with the rest of her neighbour
virgins) to see this solemnity: at which instant arrived the
Marquesse with all his gracious company, meeting with Grisel
as shee was carrying two pitchers of water to her poore fathers
house. Of whom (calling her by her name) he asked where
her father was? She humbly answered, in the house. Goe
then, said hee, and tell him I would speak with him. So the
poore old man (made the poorer by this astonishment) came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>forth to the lord somewhat appauled, till the Marquesse, taking
him by the hand, with an extraordinary chearefulnesse said, that
he had a secret to impart unto him, and so, sequestering him
from the company, spake these words:—Janicola, I know that
you alwaies loved me, and am resolved that you doe not now
hate me. You have been glad when I have been pleased, and
will not now bee sorrowful if I bee satisfied: nay, I am sure,
if it lie in your power, you will further my delight, and not bee
a contrary to my request. For I intend to begge your daughter
for my wife, and bee your sonne in lawe for your advancement.
What saiest thou, man? wilt thou accept mee for a friend, as
I have appointed thee for a father?</p>

<p class='c007'>The poore ould man was so astonished, that he could not
looke up for teares, nor speak a word for joy; but when the
extasie had end, hee thus faintly replied:—My gracious soueraigne,
you are my lord, and therefore I must accord to your
will; but you are generous, and therefore I presume on your
vertue; take her a Gods name, and make mee a glad father;
and let that God, which raiseth the humble and meek, make
her a befitting wife, and fruitful mother. Why then, replied
the Marquesse, let us enter your house, for I must ask her a
question before you. So hee went in, the company tarrying
without in great astonishment: the faire maid was busied to
make it as handsome as she could, and proud againe to have
such a guest under her roofe; amazed at nothing but why hee
should come so accompanied, and little conjecturing of so great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>a blessing approaching. But, at last, the Marquesse took her
by the hand, and used these speeches:—To tell you this blush
becomes you, it were but a folly; and that your modesty hath
graced your comlines, may prove the deceit of words, and
unbefitting my greatnes; but in a word, your father and I
have agreed to make you my wife, and I hope you will not
disagree to take me to your husband. For delay shall not
intangle you with suspicion, nor two daies longer protract the
kindnes; onely I must be satisfied in this, if your heart afford
a willing entertainement to the motion, and your vertue a constancy
to this resolution, not to repine at my pleasure in any
thing, nor presume on contradiction, when I determine to command.
For as amongst good souldiers, they must simply obey
without disputing the businesse: so must vertuous wives dutifully
consent withoute reproofe, or the least contraction of a
brow. Therefore be advised how you answer, and I charge
you take heed, that the tongue utter no more then the heart
conceits. All this while Grisel was wondring at the miracle,
had not religion told her that nothing was impossible to the
commander of all things; which reduced her to a better consideration
and thus brought forth an answere.</p>

<p class='c007'>My gracious lord, I am not ignorant of your greatnesse, and
know mine owne basenesse: there is no worth in me to be your
servant, therefore there can be no desert to be your wife: notwithstanding,
because God will be the author of miraculous
accidents, I yeeld to your pleasure, and praise him for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>fortune; onely this I will be bold to say, that your will shall be
my delight, and death shall be more welcome unto mee then a
word of displeasure against you.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is sufficient, answered the great lord, and so most
lovingly he took her by the hand, and brought her to the company,
even before all his peeres and great ladies, and told them
she should bee his wife, so that wherein they extended their
love, reverence, and obedience toward her, he could exemplifie
his regard, care, and diligence toward them. And because
outward shewes doe sometimes grace befitting actions (lest her
poverty and basenes might too much daunt their expectation,
and seeme disgratious to their noblenes), he commanded them
with a morall livelinesse to adorne her with the richest robes
they had; so that it was a pleasure to see how the ladies bestird
themselves, a delight to behould the severall services performed,
the many hands about her, the jewels and pendants, the robes
and mantles, the ornaments and coronets, the collanaes and
chaines, with all other particulars and accoustrements, but when
she was apparelled indeed, it was a ravishment exceeding report,
and they which stomached her preferment were now delighted
with her glory. Such a benefit hath beauty by nature, and
gratiousnesse by nurture.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chap. III.</span><br /> <span class='c010'>How the Marquesse and Grisel were married together.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After the ladies had thus adorned poore Grisel with robes
befitting her estate, the Marquesse and all the noble company
returned to Saluss, and in the Cathedrall Church, in sight of the
people, according to the fulnesse of religious ceremonies, they
were espoused together, and with great solemnitie returned to
the palace. Herein yet consisted the admiration, that no word
of reproach was murmured, nor eie looked unpleasantly upon
her; for by her wonderfull demeanour shee had gained so much
of opinion that the basenes of her birth was not thought upon,
and all her graces concurring made them verely beleeve shee
was extracted of princely lineage: no man once supposed that
shee could be Grisel, daughter to poore Janicola, but rather
some creature metamorphosed by the powers of heaven: for
besides the outward statelinesse and majestical carriage of herselfe,
the wonderfull modestie and exact symmetry of her countenance,
the admirable beauty and extraordinary favor of her
visage, her faire demeanour had a kinde of attraction, and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>gratious words a sweet delivery; so that all that came to her
were glad of their accesse, and they which went from her
triumphed for their good speed: yea, report extended so far,
that she was not onely visited by her owne lords and ladies with
reverence, but attended on with strangers, who came from all
quarters to see her and to bee behoulding to their owne judgements;
so that if the Marquesse loved her before for her own
worth, he now reverenced her for others respect; the rather,
because he found a blessing attending her presence, and all
people pleased in the contract? For when any controversie
hapned betweene himselfe and his nobles, she was so nobly
minded, that what she could not obtaine by fair intreaty she
yet mitigated by sweet perswasion. When any unkindnes
hapned of forraine prince, shee urged those blessings of peace,
and reasoned the matter with delightsom enforcement; and
when the people were either complained of, or against, he marvelled
from whence she had those pretty reasons to asswage his
anger, and they verely beleeved shee was sent from heaven for
their releefe. Thus was shee amiable to her lord, acceptable to
her people, profitable to her country, a mirror of her sexe, a
person priviledged by nature, and a wonder of the time, in
which she did nothing out of time; so that the Marquesse was
rather ravished than loving, and all his subjects resolved to
obedience from her good example.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chap. IV.</span><br /> <span class='c010'>How the lady Grisel was proved by her husband, who thus made triall of her patience.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To other blessings, in processe of time, there was added the
birth of a sweet infant, a daughter, that rejoiced the mother,
and gladded the father: the country triumphed, and the people
clapped their hands for joy; for the Marquesse still loved her
more and more, and they thought their lives not deere for her,
if occasion served. Notwithstanding all this, Fortune hath still a
tricke to checke the pride of life, and prosperity must be seasoned
with some crosses, or eke it would taint and corrupt us
too much: whereupon, the Marquesse determined now to
prove his wife, and make triall of her vertues indeed; and so
taking a convenient season, after the childe was fully weaned,
he one day repaired secretly to her chamber, and (seeming halfe
angry) thus imparted his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although, Grisel, this your present fortune hath made you
forget your former estate, and that the jollity of your life overswayeth
the remembrance of your birth, yet neither is it so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>with me, nor my nobles; for I have some occasion of distasting,
and they great cause of repining, in that they must be
subject to one so base, and have still before their eyes our
children of such low degree; so that though (for my sake)
they make good semblance of the present, yet are they resolved
never to suffer any of our posterity to rule over them; of
which, as they have disputed with mee, I cannot chuse but
forewarne you. Therefore, to prevent this discontentment
betweene us, and to maintaine that peace which must corroborate
my estate, I must needes yeelde to their judgements, and
take away your daughter from you, to preserve their amity:
the thing I know must be displeasing to nature, and a mother
cannot well indure such a losse; but there is now no remedy:
only make use of your first resolutions, and remember what
you promised me at the beginning of our contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady, hearing this sorrowfull preamble, and apprehending
the Marquesse resolution, to her griefe, (although every
word might have beene as arrowes in her sides) yet admitting
of the temptation, and disputing with herselfe to what end the
vertues of patience, modesty, forbearance, fortitude, and magnanimity
were ordained, if they had not subjects to worke upon,
and objects to looke after, thus replyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>My lord, you are my soveraigne, and all earthly pleasures
and contentments of my life come from you, as the fountaine
of my happinesse, and therefore please your selfe, and (beleeve
it) it is my pleasure you are pleased; as for the child, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the gift of God, and yours. Now he that gives may take
away, and as wee receive blessings from heaven, so must we
not dote on them on earth, lest by setting our minds too much
upon them, wee cannot set off our hearts when they are taken
from us; only one thing I desire, that you remember I am a
mother; and if I burst not out into passion for her losse, it is
for your sake I am no more perplexed, and so you shall ever
find mee a wife befitting your desires.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Marquesse saw her constancy, and was in a
manner pleased with her modest answere, hee replied not at all
at that time; for his heart was full, and what betweene joy
and feare he departed: joy that so great vertue had the increase
of goodnesse, feare that he had presumed too farre on
such a trial. But resolved in his businesse, hee went to put it
to the adventure.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chap. V.</span><br /> <span class='c010'>The Marquesse sent a varlet for his daughter; but privately disposed of her with his sister, the Dutchesse of Bologna de Grace, who brought her up in all things befitting the childe of so great a person.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Not long after this sad conference between the Marquesse
and his lady, hee called a faithfull servant unto him; such a
one as the poet talks of, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter fidem et taciturnitatem dilectum</span></i>,
to whom hee imparts this secrecy, and with severall instructions,
what hee truly meant to do with the child, sent him to
his wife with an unsavory message, which yet hee delivered in
this manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>I had not now come to you, most noble lady, though that
power commanded me which hath my life in subjection, if I
had not more relied upon your wisdome and vertue, than
feared death it selfe. Therefore I crave pardon if I am displeasing
in my message, and seeme cruell (as it were) in tearing
your flesh from your sides, by bereaving you of this your
daughter; for hee hath appointed it that must not bee gainsaid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and I am a messenger that cannot bee denied. But yet with
what unwillingnes (God knowes my soule) in regard that you
are so respected amongst us, that wee think of nothing but
what may delight you, and talk not a word but of your merit
and worthinesse.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she had heard him out, remembring the conference
the Marquesse had with her, and apprehending there was no
disputing in a matter remedilesse, especially with a messenger,
shee resolved it was ordained to dy; and although shee must now
(as it were) commit it to a slaughter-house, whereby any woman
in the world might with good becomming have burst out into
some passion, and well enough shewed a distracted extasie, yet
recollecting her spirits, and reclaiming those motives of nature
already striving in her bowels, shee tooke the childe in her armes,
and with a mothers blessing and sweetned kisses, the countenance
somewhat sad, and the gesture without any violent excruciation,
delivered it unto the fellow, not once amazed or distempred,
because her lord would have it so, and shee knew not how to
have it otherwise: only she said, I must, my friend, intreat one
thing at your hands, that out of humanity and Christian observation,
you leave not the body to bee devoured of beasts or birds,
for it is worthy of a grave in her innocency, and Christian
buriall, though shee were but my daughter alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fellow having received the childe, durst not tarry for
feare of discovery (such impression had her words made already),
but returned with it to his maister, not leaving out the least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>circumstance of her answer, nor any thing that might enlarge
her renown and constancy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Marquesse, considering the great vertue of his wife, and
looking on the beauty of his daughter, began to enter into a
kinde of compassion, and to retract his wilfulnesse; but at last
resolution won the field of pity, and having (as he thought) so
well begunne, would not so soone give over, but with the same
secrecy hee had taken her from his wife, hee sent it away to his
sister, the Dutchess of Bologna, with presents of worth, and
letters of gratification, containing in them the nature of the
businesse, and the manner of her bringing up, which she accordingly
put in practice, receiving her neece with joy, and instructing
her with diligence; so that it soone appeared under what a
tutelage shee was, and whose daughter shee might be. For her
pregnancy learned whatsoever they taught her, and the grace
she added, quickly discovered that honour had confederated with
nature to make her the offspring of such a mother.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chap. VI.</span><br /> <span class='c010'>The Marquesse, not contented with this proofe, tooke away also her sonne, in which adversity (with other additions) she shewed an extraordinary patience.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After this tempest was overpast, the rage whereof might
easily have broken the tender sides of poore Grisels barke (for
shee verely beleeved that her daughter was slaine), the Marquesse
still lay in waite for the trial of his wife, watching every opportunity
which might acquaint him with her discontentments;
especially if he might understand whether she complained of his
rigorousnesse and unkindnesse, or no: but when he not only was
advertised of her constancy and faire demeanour, but saw (by
experience) that shee was neither elated in prosperity, nor
dejected in adversity; when hee perceiued so great a temperature
betweene the joy of her advancement and the sorrow for her
trouble, he wondred at her constancy; and the rather, because
her love and observation toward him continued with that sweetnes,
and had such delectable passages, that his heart was set on
fire againe, and hee knew not how to allay the extreamities of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>his joy. In this manner passed foure yeeres, wherein she overpassed
all of her kinde, and he thought it a donative from
heaven to have such a wife. At last nature bestird herselfe
againe, and made her a happy mother of a faire sonne; the joy
whereof led the whole country into the house of praier and
thanksgiving, and brought them home againe by cresset-light
and bonfires, so that she well perceived how acceptable she was
to her people and beloved of her husband. Notwithstanding,
with the same water that drave the mill hee drowned it, and
made her still beleeve the contrary; for after two yeeres, that
the childe was past the danger of a cradle, and the trouble of
infancy, he tooke occasion once againe to inflict upon the
vertuous Grisel a new punishment, erecting his building upon
the old foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>You knowe, saith hee, what former contentions I have had
with my nobility about our marriage; not that they can lay any
imputation on you or your worthy behavior, but on my fortune
and disasterous affection to match myselfe so meanly: wherein
yet their forward exprobation was rebated, all the while we
either had no children, or that they supposed that which we had
to be taken from us; all which ariseth out of the error of
ambition (which in a manner is carelesse of vertue) respecting
nothing but a high progeny. So that ever since this child was
borne there hath passed many secret grudgings, and unkinde
speeches against it, as if it were a disparagement to their greatnesse
to have a lord of so meane parentage, and the country to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>be subject to the grand child of Janicola, whom you see never
since our marriage they would admit to place of honor, or to
overtop them by way of association, nor will suffer this my
Gualter, though it carry the fathers name, to rule over them.
Therefore, to allay the heat of these present fires, and to preserve
the peace of my estate (by preventing the mischief of future
troubles), I am resolved to settle my contentment, and to deale
with your sonne as I have dealt with your daughter. And of
this I thought it good to advertise you, as a preparative for
patience, lest sorrow should distract you with oversuddennesse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now you ladies and dames of these times, that stand upon
tearmes of spirit and greatnesse of heart (some will have it
courage and magnanimity of minde), that are affrighted at the
character of a foole, and silly poore soule; I speake not of
strumpets, or of such as are willing to brand themselves with
the impurity of uncleannesse, and dare out of impudency or
cunning tell their husbands to their faces they will go where
they list, and do what they please, but of such that under that
impregnable target of honestie are yet so impatient at every distemperature,
that they dare answer taunt for taunt: yea, like
viragoes indeed, offer the first blow, though a horrible confusion
follow, what would you have answered this lord? or with what
fire-works would you have made your approches unto him?
I will not tarry for your answere, lest I pull the old house in
peeces, and so, though I scape the timber, I may be crushed
with the rubbish; but I will now anticipate (or prevent) all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>objections by telling you what faire Grisel said; and if there
bee hope of reformation, insert it as a caution to divert you from
your naturall fiercenes.</p>

<p class='c007'>When shee had heard him out, though to the griefe of her
soule, she conceived the murther of her childe, and that the
apprehension renewed the sorrow of her daughters losse; yet
would she give no way to such distemperature, that either hee
should have cause to suspect her patience, or shee herselfe the
temptation of disquiet, and therefore thus replied:—My lord, I
have many times told you, that my soule rejoiceth in nothing
but in your reposednes, for you are the lord of me and this
infant; and though I could bee contented to shew myselfe a
mother in his education, and bring him now and then unto you
as the pledge of our loves, yet are you the commander of my
vowes, and I will rectifie all disordered appetites by the rule of
your pleasure. Take him then, a Gods name, and if hee be
marked for death, it is but the common brand of all creatures;
nay, if the mother may be a sacrifice of propitiation to appease
your disquiet, never was lamb so meek, nor holocaust so willing
to bee offred. For, what may bee comprehended under the
titles of father, kinred, children, friends, life, pleasure, honours,
and contentment, are all comprised under your love, and the
society of a husband. Do with mee, then, what you please:
the body shall serve your turne while it lives, and the soule
attend you after death.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Here was an answer to pacifie the tyrants of Sicilie, and put
a man quite out of his tract of proving such a wife! Yet the
Marquesse onely made use of it to rejoice in the assurance of
her goodness, and went the rather forward in his dangerous
course of temptation.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chap. VII.</span><br /> <span class='c010'>The Marquesse, resolute to prove his wife further, sendeth for his son, and disposeth of him as he had done of his daughter.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As this patient and wonderfull lady was one day sporting
with her infant, like an untimely tempest (spoiling the beauty
of some new rooted plants) did this messenger of death interpose
himselfe betweene her recreation, making the hollow
demand of her sonne worse than the noise of a schrich-owle
over a sick mans bed: yet (as if there were a conscience in
disquieting her greatnes, or if you will, her goodnes) he came
forward with preambles and apologies, insinuating, with craving
pardon, the authority of a lord, the duty of a servant, the
terrour of death, the circumstance of obedience, and all other
enforcements which might either excuse a messenger, or make
the message of it selfe without blame. What should I enlarge
a discourse of terrour? it is a curtesie to conclude a mischiefe
with quicknes. Hee was not so sudden in his demand, as shee
was ready in her dispatch, for she presently blest the child,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>kissed it, crossed it, adorned it, and delivered it to the executioner:
onely with the same enforcement shee pleaded, as shee
had spoken of in the behalfe of her daughter, not to see it
perish for lack of a buriall, or devoured for want of a grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this manner, and with this report, hee returned to his
lord, who had still more cause of amazement, and lesse reason
to trouble such a creature, had not his wilfulnes put him forward
to make an end of his businesse, and taught him still
variety of trying this gold in the fire. But for the time hee
sent likewise this childe to his sister, the Duchesse of Bologna
(yet some will have her but Countesse of Paniche), who, understanding
her brothers minde, brought up both these children in
such a fashion, that though no man knew whose children they
were, yet they imagined whose they might bee; that is, the son
and daughter of some prince, or other potentate, willing to have
his children brought up to the best purpose, and befitting their
birth and honour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ordering of this businesse in this sort made the Marquesse
once againe settle himselfe in Saluss, where he kept open
house to all comers, and was proud of nothing so much as the
honour of his wife, and the love of his people: for although he
had thus tried her patience and constancy, giving her more than
sufficient cause of anguish and perturbation, yet coulde he not
finde fault, or had the least demonstration of offence, but still
she loved him more and more, and was so observingly dutifull
and cautelous of displeasure, that many times he grew enamored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>of that he might command, and seemed passionate in the distractions
of over-joy. Nor could the length of time make this
love wearisome, for all they had lived thus a dozen years
together; onely shee got the hand of him in the opinion of the
people, who by this beganne to whisper against his unkindnes,
that had married so vertuous a woman, and bereaved her of two
children; so that if they were slaine, it was a murther, if
otherwise, it was unkindnesse. For though shee were poore
Janicolas daughter by birth, yet she might come from heaven
for her vertue, and was sure to go thither for her piety. Notwithstanding
these breakings out, which came often to the eares
of his honour, such was her moderation and his government,
that they only whisperd the same on her behalfe, and contented
themselves with the expectation of future good, as they had the
fruition of present happinesse, not meddling with the same further,
than in the commiseration of her, and still acknowledging their
duty to him; so that although hee knew shee might this way
understand his former reasons of taking away her children, that
it was but a devise, and that there were some other motives,
which procured this unkindnes, yet was he still obstinate to
exercise her patience, and conceit beat out another plot of
offence on the anvill of a loving, yet most hardned heart.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h3 id='IX' class='c004'><span class='sc'>Chap. IX.</span><br /> <span class='c010'>The Marquesse, to try his lady further, made her beleeve hee would marry another wife.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Some dozen years were passed since the Marquesse of Saluss
had sent his daughter to Bologna, to his sister (as you have
heard), who was by this time growne to that beautie, comelinesse,
and perfection, that her fame busied all Europe; and the lady
Grisel, her mother, was made acquainted with her excellency,
whereupon, he very strangely sent to Rome, by a messenger of
trust, for counterfeit letters to marrie [t]his paragon, and to bee
dispensed from his first wife. Which was so effectually dispatched,
that the messenger soone returned with the approbation of his
request, and hee himselfe had many allegations in readinesse to
excuse the matter, intimating the good of the countrie, and the
continual desire of his people for the alteration; which, although
it was far from probability, because they pitied their ladies distresse,
and rather repined against their lords inconstancy, yet it
served his turne for the time, and he thereupon erected the
frame of this second marriage. By this time is the faire Grisel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>acquainted with the businesse, and troubled at the misfortune;
but having many times plaied the wanton with affliction, she
resettled herself to endure whatsoever should be imposed; so
that when she came to the proofe, indeed, nothing affronted
her constancy nor humbled her lower then her own vertue had
taught her the way.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the mean while, the Marquesse had under hand sent to
the Count of Paniche and his sister, to bring him his children
with all the pompe and glory they could prepare, with caution
not to discover their names, and to be at a day appointed at
Saluss: so that it passed for current all over the country that a
lady, a yong, brave, and gallant lady, of great lineage, and greater
worth, of high renown and mighty affinity, was comming into
Saluss to be espoused to the Marquesse, and that they were
already come out of Bologna de Grace, a whole dayes journey
forward, with such a troope and company that it was a shew of
magnificence, and a spectacle of delight. For amongst the rest
there was a young lord, not fully eight yeere old, whose bravery
and gallantnesse drewe all mens eyes with admiration toward
him, had not the lady divided the gazing, and shared with their
opinion. For, besides her riches and outward ornaments, her
youth (as not fully thirteene) and upright comelinesse, her
bewty and gracious behauiour, she was of extraordinary stature,
and majestike presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>These things thus disposed and handsomely carried, the Marquesse
tooke an opportunity thus to speak to the disconsolate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Grisel before all his people. In times past, I confesse, you
deserved my love, and notwithstanding the disparity betweene
us, I thought it well bestowed upon you; nay, I cannot now
impute any ill desert unto you: notwithstanding, for some
reasons to myselfe best knowne, of which I have made the holy
father acquainted, I am resolved to take another wife; who, as
you heare, is on the way hitherward already: wherefore I would
advise you to retire to your fathers cotage, till you heare further
from me.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alas! my lord, replied the sweet soule, I ever disputed the
matter with reason, that there was no equality betweene so
great magnificence and my humiliation, and in the greatest
assurance of my prosperity, reputed my selfe a vassaile and
handmaid, proud of nothing but my owne readinesse to be at
your command, and your willingnes to employ mee in your
affaires; so that, I take God to my witnes, I scarce trusted
my selfe with the name of a wife, when I was in the best
assurance. Therefore, I must acknowledge what you have
heretofore vouchsafed as a part of great bounty, and the very
fruits of your generousnes. As for returning to my poore fathers
house, I am most willing; and there, as you please, like a
forlorne widow will spend the rest of my dayes; yet remember
I was your wife, espoused orderly, and you have had children
by mee, so that if I there dye, I must yet dye the widow of
such a lord, and for honors sake be so reputed. As for your
new spouse, God grant her many daies of comfort, and you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>many yeeres of joy, that you may live in reciprocall delight one
with another, and intertaine no worse contentment than poore
Grisel accustomed. As for my dowry I brought, I brought only
my selfe, and will have no more back againe, which was faith,
love, reverence, poverty and virginity; for, as I came naked
from my fathers house, I am contented to return so againe.
Your jewels are in the wardrobe, and even the ring you married
me withal, in the chamber: of this I weare, I shall quickly be
disrobed, and if there be any further misery appointed, my
patience can endure it, if your pleasure impose it; onely in
recompence of my virginitie, I request a poore smocke to hide
that wombe from public overlooking that was once so private
to so great a prince; and because it was the bed of your infants,
let it not bee the scorne of your people, but give mee leave thus
to goe out of the palace, that hereafter times may wonder how
quietly a woman yeelded to so great a change. Nay, let no
man shed a teare, I must bee more naked than so; for though
the wife of a Marquesse while I lived, and the widow when I
died, yet am I not too good for a grave, but in despight of pride
must return to dust and ashes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Did I say before, they began to weep? I can assure you,
when she had done, they roared out-right; yea, the Marquesse
himselfe shed so many teares that he was faine to retire, and
commanded the smock she had begged to be sent unto her, that
shee might prosecute the enterprise, and he determine his
businesse, as he had constantly projected.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Before I proceed any further in this wonderfull discovery, I
am sure two things will bee objected against mee: first, the impossibility
of the story; secondly, the absurdity of the example.
For the story I answer, that therefore it was thus published
and connected together, for the rarity of the businesse, and the
sweetnes of the successe, nor is it any way stranger than
many Roman passages, and Grecian discourses. For the application,
it is both necessary and befitting; for whereas in the
condition of women, amongst many other, there bee two especiall
errours against the modesty of their sex, and quietnes of
their husbands, videlicet, superiority and desire of liberty (I
name not irregular behaviour, household inconveniences, and
domesticks strife), this one example (as Hercules did the serpents)
strangles them both in the cradle, and though it cannot
prevent, yet will it exprobrate the fault. First concerning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>superiority. I hope the instances of scripture are not made
canonicall to no purpose, and out of reason and naturall inforcement:
what a filthinesse is it to a generous spirit, to have a
woman so presumptuous as to take an account of her husband’s
actions and businesse? Wherein many times they are so
peremptory, that I have seene them enter the rooms of privacy,
where secret businesses of strangers have been imparted, and
were to be discussed, nor hath this been done with a lovely
insinuation, or cunning excuse of longing, or willingness to be
instructed, or other pretty inducements to permission, but with
a high commanding voice, and impudent assurances of their
owne worth: yea, I have knowne them breake open letters
before they came to their husbands’ overlooking, and have wondred
even at souldiers themselves, that would give way to such
indecency. Againe, to be counter-checked in this wilfulnes,
what clamours have beene raised! what tumults and discomforts
occasioned! that instead of awful obedience and delightsome
affability, they have burst out into outragiousnes, commanded
teares of mischeife, and threatned suspicious revenges.
But let them soile themselves in the filthinesse of this humour
never so much. I say plainely, that though their husbands were
fooles by nature, yet is it not befitting for a wife to discover the
same, or over-rule in forren affaires, I meane matters which
concerne them not: for there is no great man so weake but
hath councell and supportation of inferior officers, nor mean
man so sottish but hath friends or servants in the dispatch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>his businesse. Secondly, concerning the desire of liberty: oh,
hellish device of the divell, and fearefull custome both of France
and England! I hope he that knowes the fashions of the
East, of Muscovy, Spain, Italy, and the Mores, understands
that no married wife goes abroad but to honorable purposes;
and it is an introduction to death to salute any stranger, or be
seene in private conference. For, in true understanding, what
businesse should any man have with my wife three houres together
in private? or why, without my leave, and that upon
good grounds, should shee wander in publike? I speake not to
overthrow noble societies, generous entertainment, familiar invitations,
curteous behaviour, charitable welcomes, honest recreations,
or peradventure, the imparting of private businesse; but
meerly against foppish wantonesse, idle talke, suspicious meetings,
damnable play-hunting, disorderly gaming, unbefitting
exercises, and in a word, all such things as tend to obscenity
and wickednes; in which (say what women can), if there be
not a moderation by nature, there must be an inforcement by
judgement; and that woman that will not be ruled by good
councell must be over-ruled by better example,—of which, this
now in hand (of Lady Grisel) is a mirror, and transparent
chrystall to manifest true vertue, and wifely duty indeed; and
so I come to the wonder of her obedience.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the Marquesse was resolved to the last act of her tryall,
and had sent her the smocke shee demanded, amongst all the
lords, knights, ladies, and other company, she presently disrobed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>her selfe, and went, so accompanied, from the palace to her
father’s cottage, who, as you have heard (for divers reasons),
was only kept from want, but never advanced out of the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>The company could not choose but weepe and deplore the
alteration of fortune; she could not choose but smile, that her
vertue was predominant over passion: they exclaimed against
the cruelty of her lord, she disclaimed the least invective against
him: they wondred at so great vertue and patience, she resolved
them they were exercises befitting a modest woman:
they followed her with true love and desire to doe her good,
she thanked them with a true heart, and request to desist from
any further deploring of her estate.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time they approached the house, and the poore old
man, Janicola, acquainted with the hurli-burly, came out to see
what the matter was. And finding it was his daughter in her
smocke, and in so honourable a company, bemoaning her distresse,
he quickly left them all unspoke unto, and ran in for
those poore robes, which were formerly left in the house; with
which hee quickly arayed her, and told her before them all,
that now shee was in her right element, and, kissing her, bad
her welcom. The company was as much astonished at his
moderation as at her constancie, wondring how nature could
bee so restrained from passion, and that any woman had such
grace to be so gracious; in which amaze, not without some
reprehension of fortune, and their lord’s cruelty, they left her
to the poverty of the cell, and returned themselves to the glory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>of the palace, where they recounted to the Marquesse the
strangenesse of the businesse, and the manner of the accidents,
and shee continued in her first moderation and indefatigable
patience, the poore father onely laughing to scorne the miseries
and sodaine mutabilitie of humane condition, and comforting
his daughter in her well-begun courses of modesty and reposednesse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not long after approched the Countesse of Paniche, or, if
you will, Duchesse of Bologna, with her glorious company and
beautifull lady, sending word before hand that she would be at
Saluss such a day: whereupon the Marquesse sent a troope to
welcome her, and prepared the court for her intertainment;
the bruit of which yet had not so equall a passage, but divers
contrarious opinions thus bandied themselves; some absolutely
condemnied the inconstancie of the lord, others deplored the
misfortune of the lady, some repined to see a man so cruell
against so great worthinesse, others exemplified her praises to
all eternitie; some were transported with the gallant youth and
comelinesse of this new bewtifull virgine, others presumed to
parallell the faire Grisel, but that shee had stepped a little
before her in yeeres; some harped upon her great nobilitie and
high lineage, others compared the former wife’s vertue and true
wisdome; some excused their lord, by the love to his countrey,
others excused the lady by the nature of the adversitie, untill
the approach of the faire virgine and the young noble man in
her company extinguished all former conceits, and set them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>a new worke, concerning this spectacle, wherein the young
lady and her brave brother had such pre-eminence. Nor knewe
the Earle of Paniche himselfe, or any of the company on either
side, that they were his owne children by Grisel, but meerly
strangers, and designed for this new mariage. So the great
Marquesse made good semblance, and with his accustomed
courtlinesse welcomed them all to the palace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very next morning (or, if you will, the day before), he
sent a messenger for Grisel to come unto him in the very same
manner as shee was; who protracted no time, but presently
attended her lord: at her approach he was somewhat appalled,
but yet setting (as wee say) the best foot forward, hee thus
proceeded:</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady, Grisel, with whom I must marrie, will bee here
to-morrow by this time, and the feast is prepared accordingly:
now, because there is none so well acquainted with the secrets
of my palace, and disposition of my selfe as you, I would have
you, for all this base attire, addresse your wisdome to the
ordering of the businesse, appointing such officers as is befitting,
and disposing the roomes according to the degrees and estate of
the persons. Let the lady have the priviledge of the mariage
chamber, and the young lord the pleasure of the gallery:
let the rest be lodged in the courts, and the better sort upon the
sides of the garden: let the viands be plentifull, and the ceremonies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>maintained: let the showes bee sumptuous, and the
pastimes as it becommeth; in a word, let nothing be wanting,
which may set forth my honour, and delight the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>My lord, saith shee, I ever told you I took pleasure in nothing
but your contentment, and whatsoever might consort to your
delight, therein consisted my joy and happinesse: therefore,
make no question of my diligence and duty in this, or any other
thing which it shal please you to impose upon me. And so
like a poore servant shee presently addressed herselfe to the
businesse of the house, performing all things with such a
quicknes and grace that each one wondred at her goodnesse
and faire demeanour, and many murmured to see her put to
such a triall. But the day of entertainement is now comme,
and when the faire lady approached, her very presence had
almost extinguished the impression of Grisels worthinesse; for
some inconstant humourists gave way to the alteration, not
blaming the Marquesse for such a change. But when the
strangers were made acquainted with the fortune of Grisel, and
saw her faire demeanour, they could not but esteeme her a
woman of great vertue and honour, being more amased at her
patience then at the mutability of mans conditions; till at last
shee approached the lady, and taking her by the hand, used this
speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lady, if it were not his pleasure, that may command to bid
you welcome, yet me thinks there is a kinde of over-ruling
grace from nature in you, that must exact a respect unto you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>And as for you, yong lord, I can say no more, but if I might
have my desires satisfied in this world, they should be imploied
to wish you well, and to endeavour all things for your entertainement
indeed. To the rest I afford what is befitting,
desiring them, that if any deficiency abate their expectation,
they would impute it either to my ignorance, or negligence;
for it is the pleasure of him, in whose will is all my pleasure,
that in all sufficiency you should have regard and suppliment.
And so shee conducted them to their severall chambers, where
they reposed themselves awhile, till the time of dinner invited
them to repast. When all things were prepared, and the
solemnity of placing the guests finished, the Marquesse sent
for Grisel, and rising on his feet, took her by the hand before
them all, erecting his body, and elating his voice in this manner:
You see the lady is heere I meane to marry, and the company
gloriously prepared to witnes the same; are you therefore contented
that I shall thus dispose of my selfe, and do quietly
yeeld to the alteration?</p>

<p class='c007'>My lord, replied she before them all, wherein as a woman I
might be faulty, I will not now dispute; but because I am your
wife, and have devoted my selfe to obedience, I am resolved to
delight in nothing but your pleasure; so that if this match be
designed for your good, and determined by your appointment, I
am much satisfied, and more then much contented. And for
you, lady, I wish you the delights of your marriage and the
honour of your husband, many yeares of happinesse, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>fruits of a chaste wedlock: only, gracious lord, take heed of one
thing; that you trie not this new bride as you have done your
ould wife; for she is yong, and peradventure of another straine,
and so may want of that patience and government which I,
poore I, have endured.</p>

<p class='c007'>Till this he held out bravely; but nature overcomming resolution,
and considering with what strange variety his unkindnesse
had passed, hee could not answere a word for teares, and
all the company stood confounded at the matter, wondring
what would be the end of the businesse, and the successe of the
extasie. But to draw them out of their doubts, the next
chapter shall determine the controversie.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>After a little reducement of his passion, and that time and
further meditation had disposed his senses to their perfect estate,
the Marquesse graciously answered:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Thou wonder of women, and champion of true vertue! I
am ashamed of my imperfections, and tyred with abusing thee.
I have tryed thee beyond reason, and thou hast forborne mee
beyond modestie: beleeve it, therefore, I will have no wife
but thy selfe, and when God hath thought thee too good for
the earth, I will (if it bee not too much superstition) pray to
thee in heaven. Oh! ’tis a pleasure to be acquainted with thy
worth, and to come neere thy goodnes maketh a man better
than himselfe. For without controversie, except thou hadst
beene sent from above, thou couldst never have acted a goddesses
part belowe: and therefore, seeing I have used thee so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>unkindly heeretofore, I protest never to disquiet thee heereafter:
and wherein my cruelty extended against thee in bereaving thee
of thy children, my love shall now make amends in restoring
thy daughter. For this new bride is shee; and this wanton her
brother. Thank this great lady (my sister) for their bringing
up, and this man (you knowe him well enough) for his secrecy.
Bee not amased at the matter: I have related a truth, and will
confirme it on my honour; only sit downe till the dinner is
done, and bid the company welcome in this poore attire; for
the sun will break through slender clouds, and vertue shine in
base array. I could much dilate the matter, but it is time to
end, lest the circumstances will never end.</p>

<p class='c007'>This device of the Marquesses, of kissing her so lovingly,
and setting her downe by him so discreetly, did much good; for
the company had time to dispute of the miracle, and the yong
lady reason to prepare her obedience; which, no sooner was the
dinner finished, but shee as soone performed, nothing thought
upon but joy at the matter, and wonder at the accident; every
one pleased to see such a unity of goodnes, and all delighted to
have a businesse so well concluded. But seeing time had unclasped
a booke of such jollity, there was now no further disputing,
for the ladies flocked about her to attend her into the
chamber, where the yong princesse her daughter was as ready
as the best to apparell her, so that when shee came amongst
them againe she shined like the sun after a tempest, and seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>more glorious, because her continued modesty kept her from
all insulting and vaine-glorious bravery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus was the Marquesse invested, as it were, with a new
blessednes, and she continued in her ould constancy; onely
admired by every one for her patience and sufferings, and all
aplauding their reconcilement, blessing her, and the people
proud they had such a lord to obey: especially satisfied when
the poore Janicola was advanced to the councell, and made
governor of his palace; wherein hee behaved himselfe so well
that for ten yeares hee still lived as he had beene bred, a
courtier, and died with the memory of a good report. Grisel
lasted thirty yeares after him, and all went to their graves in
good time, the country renowned over the world for their
admirable government, and famosed for their extraordinary
wonder.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
